# Example Project
This example project (`vhdl_ls.toml`) demonstrates the Parser/Language Server on a medium project consiting of VUnit, OSVVM, UVVM and PoC.
In addition to this the project includes the standard VHDL library as well as the IEEE-libraries from GHDL.
The `setup.sh` script will clone all the repositories used by the example project.
